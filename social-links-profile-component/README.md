## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

During this challenge I had to use media query to make the card responsive in mobile layouts because I was having a hard time making the card responsive while only using its width.

```css
@media only screen and (max-width: 400px) {
    .card {
        padding: 30px 40px;
    }
}
```

### Continued development

Something I'll be focusing on future projects will be making applying good CSS practices and make each class reusable in different scenarios. Another thing I want to improve is the usage of media queries to improve responsiveness.
